Footnotes:
1,"To ensure respondent confidentiality, estimates below a certain threshold are suppressed. For Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia suppression is applied to all data below 1,500. The threshold level for Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan is 500, while in Prince Edward Island, estimates under 200 are supressed. For census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and economic regions (ERs), use their respective provincial suppression levels mentioned above. Estimates are based on smaller sample sizes the more detailed the table becomes, which could result in lower data quality."
2,"The country of birth of the respondent. This is based on current geographic names and boundaries at the time of collection. Due to small sample sizes by country, estimates have been aggregated by continent for more robust analysis."
3,"The sum of ""Landed immigrants"" and ""Born in Canada"" do not add up to the ""Total"". Included in the total are Canadian citizens born outside Canada and non-permanent residents."
4,"Number of persons who, during the reference week, worked for pay or profit, or performed unpaid family work or had a job but were not at work due to own illness or disability, personal or family responsibilities, labour dispute, vacation, or other reason. Those persons on layoff and persons without work but who had a job to start at a definite date in the future are not considered employed. Estimates in thousands, rounded to the nearest hundred."
5,The sum of the countries or continents do not add to the total. Oceania is included in the total but not presented individually since the population size is too small for all the breakdowns in this table.
